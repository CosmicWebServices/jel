# Jel
Jel is a scripting language developed to be simple with a hard foundation. Jel is a based off of JavaScript syntax with a Python
parser. It's main purpose is to have all elements be the same. (See Syntax.)

# Syntax
All Jel functions are written with a parentheses, such as `write('Jel is a cool language!');` and end with a semi-colon.
This makes the language overall easier to understand as some functions in JavaScript (`return`) or Python (`print`) do not follow this rule which makes those languages a tiny bit more confusing, where as in Jel, it makes it less confusing.

# Install
You can install by using npm

    npm install jel  
    
Or git clone

    git clone https://github.com/jel-lang/jel.git
