# Baran
Baran (/ber É™n/) is a backend language developed to be simple with a hard foundation.
# Syntax
All Baran functions are written with a parentheses, such as `terminal.write('Baran is a cool language!');` and end with a semi-colon.
This makes the language overall easier to understand as some functions in JavaScript (`return`) or Python (`print`) do not follow this rule
which makes those languages a tiny bit more confusing, where as in Baran, it makes it less confusing.
